            Los Angeles Community Fridges is a network of decentralized,
            independent refrigerators and pantries that provide food and vital
            supplies to our communities through mutual aid. <br /><br />Our
            mission is to strengthen communities &amp; redistribute existing
            resources by providing tools and frameworks to ensure
            people-supported, ongoing, equal access to healthy food.<br />

              <p class="paragraph-2">
                We believe a community knows what’s best for themselves. We also
                know that every location is unique and has different needs. The
                way we work is simple: we provide a scalable, repeatable
                framework to get refrigerators up and running for the
                communities that want them, so that they may work autonomously
                to support the needs at hand.

                LA Community Fridge's values are Community, Trust, Equality, Resource
                Redistribution and Mutual Aid. We encourage any individuals who
                are part of our network to embody these values as they work to
                serve their communities. With this in mind, LACF has taken time
                internally to discuss our role in the greater Los Angeles
                community and how we can work to support a more decentralized,
                independent network of free fridges.

            <div class="text-block-2">
              Los Angeles specifically has a rampant culture of gentrification.
              It would be ignorant and dangerous to embark on this project
              without acknowledging the role that LA businesses and development
              play in displacing individuals, families, and communities. It is
              also important for us to be mindful of the ways in which that
              displacement affects many of those experiencing food insecurity.
              With this in mind, we have created a questionnaire of things we
              ask potential hosts and would like for you to consider before
              reaching out to volunteer your space. We also recommend speaking
              to your landlord, property manager, and neighboring businesses
              before setting up. A main priority of this project is to ensure
              the safety and comfort of those using the fridge. These fridges
              are by and for the community; they are not PR tools for businesses
              to capitalize upon “activist” optics. <br /><br />Los Angeles
              Community Fridges will not accept monetary donations without
              creating a public budget in which we account for every dollar that
              we will be receiving. We do not want to sit on money. However, we
              are happy to refer those wishing to donate money to other
              fridges/fridge networks or groups addressing food insecurity that
              do accept monetary donations. Many resources that we need can be
              found for free or low cost with a little extra effort, and we
              encourage redistribution of existing resources as a way of helping
              to eliminate food waste. However, we will never discourage
              individuals or groups from buying groceries or other supplies for
              a fridge.<br /><br />Thank you to every person who has donated to,
              cleaned, transported, taken food from, and otherwise interacted
              with the fridges. We look forward to continuing to work together
              to support free fridges and resources for all!<br />
