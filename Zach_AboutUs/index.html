              <p class="paragraph-2">We believe a community knows what’s best for themselves. We also know that every location is unique and has different needs. The way we work is simple: we provide a scalable, repeatable framework to get refrigerators up and running for the communities that want them, so that they may work autonomously to support the needs at hand.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-3">LACF’s values are Community, Trust, Equality, Resource Redistribution and Mutual Aid. We encourage any individuals who are part of our network to embody these values as they work to serve their communities. With this in mind, LACF has taken time internally to discuss our role in the greater Los Angeles community and how we can work to support a more decentralized, independent network of free fridges.</p>

              <li class="list-item"><strong>Mutual Aid</strong> — This entails people supporting people horizontally, a reciprocal exchange.</li>
              <li class="list-item-2"><strong>Community</strong> — The individuals stocking and cleaning the fridge are using it as well.</li>
              <li class="list-item-3"><strong>Creating Connection</strong> — We’ll always connect with other community members nearby who want to support local efforts, and will connect each location with the rest of the LACF network, if desired. </li>
              <li class="list-item-4"><strong>Sharing Resources</strong> — We are learning as we grow, and are dedicated to sharing resources, frameworks and advice about what has worked or not worked for existing fridges.</li>
              <li class="list-item-5"><strong>Open Communication</strong> — We want to hear from people who are using the fridges; this includes criticisms and suggestions for improvement.</li>

              <li class="list-item-6">Government-funded or supported. We do not believe in relying on governments for our basic needs to be met, and they have shown repeatedly that they will actively work against such efforts. </li>
              <li class="list-item-8">Structured to support top-down “haves” giving to “have-nots”.</li>
              <li class="list-item-9">Set up to police, regulate or act as gatekeepers. Anyone is able to set up a fridge on their own, beyond our network.</li>
              <li class="list-item-10">Supporting or endorsing any community fridges that are exclusionary, unwelcoming, inaccessible and/or harmful to the community, or have art or messaging that functions in such a way.</li>
              <li class="list-item-11"><strong>Supporting or collaborating with any organizations that support, collaborate, or work with law enforcement or any government bodies.</strong></li>

            <h1 class="heading-11">Why We Do What We Do</h1>
            <div class="text-block-2">Los Angeles specifically has a rampant culture of gentrification. It would be ignorant and dangerous to embark on this project without acknowledging the role that LA businesses and development play in displacing individuals, families, and communities. It is also important for us to be mindful of the ways in which that displacement affects many of those experiencing food insecurity. With this in mind, we have created a questionnaire of things we ask potential hosts and would like for you to consider before reaching out to volunteer your space. We also recommend speaking to your landlord, property manager, and neighboring businesses before setting up. A main priority of this project is to ensure the safety and comfort of those using the fridge. These fridges are by and for the community; they are not PR tools for businesses to capitalize upon “activist” optics. <br><br>Los Angeles Community Fridges will not accept monetary donations without creating a public budget in which we account for every dollar that we will be receiving. We do not want to sit on money. However, we are happy to refer those wishing to donate money to other fridges/fridge networks or groups addressing food insecurity that do accept monetary donations. Many resources that we need can be found for free or low cost with a little extra effort, and we encourage redistribution of existing resources as a way of helping to eliminate food waste. However, we will never discourage individuals or groups from buying groceries or other supplies for a fridge.<br><br>Thank you to every person who has donated to, cleaned, transported, taken food from, and otherwise interacted with the fridges. We look forward to continuing to work together to support free fridges and resources for all!<br></div>
